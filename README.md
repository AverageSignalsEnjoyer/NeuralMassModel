# NeuralMassModelTravelingWaves
This code shows how (a form of) tranveling waves can be generated in a Jansen and Rit neural mass model. Specifically, a spatial grid of cortical columns each modeled by an individual neural mass model are connected to adjacent columns. Perturbing one column causes membrane depolarization of its neighbors through feedforward or feedback projections (Olivier David 2001). It makes a nice video! 

This work originally attempted to model ephaptic coupling in cortical tissue, where changes in membrane potential of one region instantly affect the membrane potential of another region through an electric field. I didn't quite get this to work since I was too lazy and frustrated to understand the biophysical parameters which would make the ephaptic coupling realistic.
